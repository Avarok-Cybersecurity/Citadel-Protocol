# Post-Quantum cryptographic algorithms

This project contains Post-Quantum cryptographic algorithms that participate in
the [NIST PQC standardization effort][nistpqc]. It is currently a collection of
wrappers around C implementations from the [PQClean][pqclean] project.

This super-crate contains the following cryptographic algorithms:
