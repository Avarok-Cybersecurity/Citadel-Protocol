# A note on the security of the included implementations and schemes

This project contains (reference) implementations of cryptographic libraries.
We do not make any security claims about the code included in [PQClean][pqclean] or packaged by [rustpq][rustpq].
In the current state, we distribute reference implementations with minor modifications.
We did not perform any extensive security analyses.
This code is suitable for experimental or scientific use.
We recommend careful expert code review before using any of the included implementations in production environments.

See also the [NIST PQC Forum][forum] for discussion about the cryptographic schemes included in PQClean.
