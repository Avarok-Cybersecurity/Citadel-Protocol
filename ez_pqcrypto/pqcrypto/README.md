# Bindings to quantum-safe cryptographic libraries

[![dependency status](https://deps.rs/repo/github/rustpq/pqcrypto/status.svg)](https://deps.rs/repo/github/rustpq/pqcrypto)


This repository contains bindings to C implementations of cryptographic algorithms part of the [NIST competition][nist].
These bindings are generated based on the [PQClean][pqclean] project, which aims to collect 'clean' implementations of cryptographic algorithms.

## How this project works.

The `pqcrypto-templates` folder contains the master copies of the Rust files.
The binding libraries are generated from the PQClean meta files and PQClean specified API.
The file `implementations.yaml` controls the version numbers and included variants of each scheme.

## Documentation

See the [documentation of the master project on docs.rs][docsrs].
