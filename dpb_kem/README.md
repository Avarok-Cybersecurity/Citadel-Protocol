# Decentralized Permission-Based Group Key Exchange Mechanism (DPB-KEM)

The goal of DPB-KEM is to enabled ratcheted group key exchange in a decentralized setting while requiring at least one authority user.

At least one authority user must be online in order to allow a new member to join. When a new member wants to join, the user must submit
a join request. This join request is then broadcasted to all online authority users.
