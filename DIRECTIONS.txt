To cross compile to aarch64, download:
android-ndk-r21d

Unpack to C:/

To setup the gradle rust plugin, set the env var:
RUST_ANDROID_GRADLE_CC=C:/android-ndk-r21d/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/windows-x86_64/bin/x86_64-linux-android30-clang.cmd

NOTE: if you don't unpack to C:/, you will need to also change the .cargo/config path in hyxe_wave and hyxe_wave/lusna_ffi

There may be other dependencies. Add them as required

To cross-compile to MAC on linux/WSL:

Note: You'll need to do the additional step of setting CC and CCX since pqcrypto requires that
