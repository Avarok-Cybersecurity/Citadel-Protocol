Pay attention to the log messages. They tell us what is happening. So, for example, in the last run, we saw Unexpected BobToAlice message since our role is not Leader, but Loser. Why might that state be reached? Is it a valid state, and we are falsely marking it as an invalid state, or, is it indeed an invalid state, and we need to improve the code? Ask questions, use logs to confirm your questions. Add code incrementally and minimally, and only make a big change if you are absolutely certain (e.g., the logs clearly support your hypothesis to your question)
