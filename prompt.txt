Ensure every file in the repository has documentation in the top of the file in the following format:
//! Title and description
//! Features/functionality overview
//! Usage examples where appropriate
//! Important notes and considerations
//! Cross-references to related components

Make sure code examples can be compiled! If you're not confident, don't make an example. Do not make stuff up, do not AI hallucinate.

DO NOT EDIT SOURCE CODE, ONLY ADD DOCUMENTATION!

Start with non lib.rs files, that way you have a full understanding before making documentation for lib.rs that are compilable. Do not document lib.rs until every other file is documented first.

While you're at it, you can simultaneously keep updating the local file ./context.ai.json, where you can store file-by-file important and distilled context as you add documentation to the top of each file, that way later on, whenever I or another needs your help, you can always reference that ./context.ai.json file. You can also keep updating ./suggestions.ai.json for a file list for suggestions we can visit later.

For both of these .ai.json files, the format should be in json:

[
    {
        file: "./citadel_*/src/lib.rs",
        suggestions: ["suggestion1", "suggestion2", ...]
    },
]

Note: for the context.ai.json file, the "suggestions" field would instead be called "context".

If you're unsure what files you've covered, since you're adding content to ./context.ai.json, you can scan that to see what files you've parsed.

Work on multiple files at a time, preferably mod by mod, starting with the deepest mod, ending with the root mod then finally lib.rs.

If the currently opened file is not documented, you should document it first, and its module if not documented.

Important: once you get to citadel_sdk, do not document lib.rs!
