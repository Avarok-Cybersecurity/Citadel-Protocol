        "John Doe",
        "john.doe",
        "password",
        "127.0.0.1:25021",
        |connect_success, remote| async move {
            let (sink, mut stream) = connect_success.channel.split();
            while let Some(message) = stream.next().await {
                // Handle incoming messages
            }
            Ok(())
        }
    )?;

    let client = NodeBuilder::default().build(client_kernel)?;
    client.await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

## 🔒 Security Architecture

The Citadel Protocol implements a novel multi-layered security approach that goes beyond traditional encryption methods:

### 🔄 Multi-layered Ratcheting
- Implements an advanced patent-pending ratcheting algorithm that operates across multiple security layers
- Each layer maintains its own independent key schedule
- Provides enhanced forward secrecy by frequently rotating keys at different intervals
- Resistant against quantum attacks through post-quantum primitives

### 🛡️ Security Modes
- *True* Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS):
  - Enforces re-keying on a per-message basis
  - Guarantees maximum security for messaging applications
  - Each message uses a new key derived from the previous state
  - Complete forward secrecy at message granularity
- Best-effort Mode (BEM):
  - Optimized for high-performance scenarios
  - Re-keys as frequently as possible without blocking message transmission
  - Maintains security while prioritizing throughput
  - Ideal for streaming and high-bandwidth applications

### 🔑 Multi-layered Key Exchange
- Multiple independent key exchanges occur simultaneously
- Combines post-quantum KEMs with traditional algorithms
- Provides defense in depth against both classical and quantum attacks
- Configurable algorithm selection for each layer

### ⚙️ Customizable Security Levels
- Flexible security modes to balance performance and security
- Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) mode with advanced ratcheting
- Best-effort Mode (BEM) for high-performance requirements
- Configurable algorithm combinations per security layer

## ⚡ Threading Modes

The Citadel Protocol provides flexible threading configurations to accommodate different performance requirements and use cases:

### Single-Threaded Mode (Default)
- 🚀 Optimized for low-latency and minimal resource usage
- 📉 Extremely low memory footprint
- ⚡ Rapid message processing with zero thread context switching
- 🎯 Ideal for:
  - Edge devices and IoT applications
  - Real-time communication systems
  - Memory-constrained environments
  - Applications prioritizing consistent low latency

### Multi-Threaded Mode
- 🔄 Parallel processing for high-throughput scenarios
- 🌐 Enhanced scalability for concurrent connections
- 💪 Optimal CPU utilization across multiple cores
- 🎯 Perfect for:
  - Server applications handling numerous concurrent clients
  - High-traffic network services
  - CPU-intensive processing tasks
  - Systems requiring maximum throughput

Enable multi-threaded mode by setting the appropriate feature flag:

```toml
[dependencies]
citadel_sdk = { version = "latest_version", features = ["multi-threaded"] }
```

## 📂 Remote Encrypted Virtual Filesystem

The Remote Encrypted Virtual Filesystem (RE-VFS) is a unique feature that enables secure remote data storage with unprecedented security guarantees:

### 🌟 Key Features
- Store encrypted data on any remote node (peer or server)
- Physical separation of data and decryption keys
- Requires compromising both storage location and client for data access
- Perfect for distributed secure storage solutions

### 🔒 Security Architecture
- Data is encrypted locally using Kyber public key encryption
- Decryption key is never stored with the data
- Uses Kyber scramcryption for minimal ciphertext size
- Optional multiple encryption layers for enhanced security

### 🎯 Use Cases
- Secure cloud storage alternatives
- Distributed backup systems
- P2P file sharing with enhanced security
- Secure document management systems

### 💻 Example Usage
```rust
use citadel_sdk::fs;

async fn store_file(remote: &mut NodeRemote) -> Result<(), Error> {
    // Write file with reinforced security
    fs::write_with_security_level(
        remote,
        "local_file.pdf",
        SecurityLevel::Reinforced,
        "/virtual/path/output.pdf"
    ).await?;

    // Read file back
    let local_path = fs::read(remote, "/virtual/path/output.pdf").await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

## 📜 Patent and Open Source Commitment

The Citadel Protocol's core technology is a [patent-pending innovative security architecture](https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/20230403261) that combines multiple novel features into a unique, highly secure communication system. Despite the patent protection, we remain committed to keeping this technology free and open source for the benefit of the entire community. This approach ensures that:

- The protocol remains freely available for everyone to use
- The patent serves to protect the technology from being closed-source or restricted
- Innovation and security improvements can continue to be community-driven
- The core technology stays accessible while being legally protected from potential abuse

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes comprehensive test suites. Use `cargo-make` for running tests:

```bash
# Install cargo-make
cargo install --force cargo-make

# Run local tests
cargo make test-local

# Run comprehensive tests (requires SQL/Redis setup)
cargo make test
```

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

While the Citadel Protocol implements cutting-edge security features:

- The project is pending third-party security audits
- Core cryptographic primitives come from verified [Open Quantum Safe (OQS)](https://openquantumsafe.org/) and [PQClean](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean) projects
- For maximum security, consider using hybrid cryptography with TLS/QUIC as underlying protocols
