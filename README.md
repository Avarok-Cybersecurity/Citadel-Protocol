### 📥 Installation

1. Add to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
citadel_sdk = "latest_version"
```

2. Setup the development environment:
```bash
cargo make install
```

### 💻 Basic Usage

#### 🖥️ Server Example
```rust
use citadel_sdk::prelude::*;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let server = NodeBuilder::default()
        .with_node_type(NodeType::server("127.0.0.1:25021")?)
        // Required for every node: there is no built-in STUN list (see "STUN servers" below)
        .with_stun_servers(["stun1.example.com:3478", "stun2.example.com:3478", "stun3.example.com:3478"])
        // Required for every server: which paths its peers may use (see "Path policy" below)
        .with_path_policy(every_path_in_order()?)
        .build(EmptyKernel::default())?;
    
    server.await?;
    Ok(())
}

fn every_path_in_order() -> Result<PathPolicy, PathPolicyError> {
    let rules = PathKind::ALL
        .into_iter()
        .map(|kind| PathRule {
            kind,
            enabled: true,
            attempt_timeout: std::time::Duration::from_secs(30),
            cost_weight: 1,
            classes: PathClasses::ALL,
        })
        .collect();
    PathPolicy::new(rules, PathClasses::NONE)
}
```

#### 📱 Client Example
```rust
use citadel_sdk::prelude::*;
use futures::StreamExt;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Create server connection settings
    let server_connection_settings = ServerConnectionSettingsBuilder::credentialed_registration(
        "127.0.0.1:12345",
        "my_username",
        "My Name",
        "notsecurepassword",
    )
    .build()?;

    // Create client kernel
    let kernel = SingleClientServerConnectionKernel::new(
        server_connection_settings,
        |connect_success, remote| async move {
            let (sink, mut stream) = connect_success.channel.split();
            while let Some(message) = stream.next().await {
                // Handle incoming messages
            }
            Ok(())
        }
    )?;

    // Execute the application
    NodeBuilder::default()
        .with_stun_servers(["stun1.example.com:3478", "stun2.example.com:3478", "stun3.example.com:3478"])
        .build(client_kernel)?
        .await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

#### 🧭 STUN servers (required)
Every node, client or server, must be given the STUN servers it learns its NAT mapping from, with
`NodeBuilder::with_stun_servers`. There is no default list: `build` fails without one. The list must
name at least three distinct `host:port` endpoints (a DNS name, an IPv4 address or a bracketed IPv6
address, and a non-zero port; no `stun:` scheme). An operator-supplied comma-separated list parses
with `"a:3478,b:3478,c:3478".parse::<StunServers>()`. Choose the servers deliberately: every node
reveals its public address to each of them. Tests under `localhost-testing` contact none, and can use
`citadel_sdk::test_common::LOCALHOST_STUN_SERVERS`.

#### 🛣️ Path policy (required for servers)
A server decides which network paths its peers may use, in which order, and for which traffic,
with `NodeBuilder::with_path_policy`. There is no default: `build` fails for a server without one.
A `PathPolicy` has exactly one `PathRule` per `PathKind` (`Direct`, `PeerRelay`, `Turn`,
`ServerRelay`), in precedence order, each with an attempt timeout of 1–60 s and the
`PathClasses` (`Control`, `Msg`, `File`, `Media`) it may carry. The server relay must carry
`Control`, and every class must be carried by some enabled path unless the policy denies it. The
server sends the policy to its clients at connect.

## 🔒 Security Architecture

The Citadel Protocol implements a novel multi-layered security approach that goes beyond traditional encryption methods:

### 🔄 Multi-layered Ratcheting
- Implements an advanced patent-pending (allowed as of Dec 2024) ratcheting algorithm that operates across multiple security layers
- Each layer maintains its own independent key schedule
- Provides enhanced forward secrecy by frequently rotating keys at different intervals
- Resistant against quantum attacks through post-quantum primitives

### 🛡️ Security Modes
- *True* Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS):
  - Enforces re-keying on a per-message basis
  - Guarantees maximum security for messaging applications
  - Each message uses a new key derived from the previous state
  - Complete forward secrecy at message granularity
- Best-effort Mode (BEM):
  - Optimized for high-performance scenarios
  - Re-keys as frequently as possible without blocking message transmission
  - Maintains security while prioritizing throughput
  - Ideal for streaming and high-bandwidth applications

### 🔑 Multi-layered Key Exchange
- Multiple independent key exchanges occur simultaneously
- Combines post-quantum KEMs with traditional algorithms
- Provides defense in depth against both classical and quantum attacks
- Configurable algorithm selection for each layer

### ⚙️ Customizable Security Levels

    // Write file with reinforced security
    fs::write_with_security_level(
        remote,
        "local_file.pdf",
        SecurityLevel::Reinforced,
        "/virtual/path/output.pdf"
    ).await?;

    // Read file back
